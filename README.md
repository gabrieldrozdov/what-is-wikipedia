# What is Wikipedia?

## What is this?
This repository is the final project for RISDâ€™s Fall 2022 grad elective, SOURCE, taught by Eric Li. The site re-imagines Wikipedia as a series of physical (or physical-inspired) spaces, allowing you to interact with and navigate to Wikipedia pages in new, exciting ways.

## How can I use this repository?
You can access the site by going to [gabrieldrozdov.github.io/what-is-wikipedia](https://gabrieldrozdov.github.io/what-is-wikipedia/).

## Who made this?
This site was designed and developed fully by Gabriel Drozdov (me!). The articles featured on the site are randomly pulled from Wikipedia using their API.
